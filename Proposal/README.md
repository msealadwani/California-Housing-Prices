The data pertains to the houses found in a given California district and some summary stats about them based on the 1990 census data.

# Dataset
To achieve the goal of this study the dataset California Housing Prices will be used. This dataset can be found at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/california-housing-prices).
There is 20641 rows and 10 columns.

This dataset contains **10 features**:
- longitude: A measure of how far west a house is; a higher value is farther west.
- latitude: A measure of how far north a house is; a higher value is farther north.
- housingmedianage: Median age of a house within a block; a lower number is a newer building.
- total_rooms: Total number of rooms within a block.
- total_bedrooms: Total number of bedrooms within a block.
- population: Total number of people residing within a block.
- households: Total number of households, a group of people residing within a home unit, for a block.
- median_income: Median income for households within a block of houses (measured in tens of thousands of US Dollars).
- medianhousevalue: Median house value for households within a block (measured in US Dollars).
- ocean_proximity: Location of the house w.r.t ocean/sea.

The sample of data is shown in the following table:

<table width="100%">
 <tr>
  <th>longitude</th><th>latitude</th><th>housing_median_age</th><th>total_rooms</th><th>total_bedrooms</th><th>population</th><th>households</th><th>median_income</th><th>median_house_value</th>
 <th>ocean_proximity</th>
 <tr>
  <th>-122.23</th><th>37.88</th><th>41.0</th><th>880.0</th><th>129.0</th><th>322.0</th><th>126.0</th><th>8.3252</th><th>452600.0</th><th>NEAR BAY</th>
 </tr>

## Tools
There are tools that will be used to achieve the goal of this study, such as: 
- pandas, numpy for exploring the data.
- matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing the data.
- scikit-learn to do our machine learning.
- statsmodels to do the regressions.
- plotly provides online graphing, analytics, and statistics tools
- Powerpoint
- Zoom
- Canva

<b>The work will be done through Jupyter notebook.</b>

## Questions that needs to be answered:
- Does the age of the house affects on the house value?
- What is the most favourite house location?
- Does the proximity of the house to the ocean or its distance from it affect its price?
- What is the relation between the number of bedrooms and the house price?
- Does the population affects on the house value?
